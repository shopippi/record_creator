# Hi, I'm Shopippi! ðŸ‘‹

Wouldn't it be very interesting to be able to display your favorite photos in a fashionable display like a vinyl record?\
I've implemented a program that edits my drawings and photos I've taken to look like vinyl records and put them on display, so use it!
## Usage/Examples

```python
from PIL import Image

    # Replace your path
    place_foreground_on_background(". /design.png", "input-filepath-your-self", "output-path")
```
